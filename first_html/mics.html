      <p>
        When buying a microphone it's important to remember what and where you'll be using it. The 3 types of devices
        commonly used with microphones
        are computers, phones, and cameras. Before buying a microphone it's important to check if it's compatible with
        your device, if it will suit your needs/environment, and if it requires
        an additional power source. Most mics that use a standard audio jack or USB allow them to be used with phones using an adapter.The 4 types of microphones we'll cover are <b id="micTypes">Dynamic, Condenser,
          Shotgun, and
          Lavalier</b>.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h2>Microphone Types</h2>

      <hr style="border: 2px solid rgb(255, 255, 255);">
      <p>
        <b>Dynamic</b> microphones are rugged and durable, meaning they are harder to blowout and harder to break via
        dropping.
        They are good for recording live vocals and instruments, they specialize with loud sounds such as a live
        concert. Since they specialize with loud sounds, to record a normal speaking level, the speaker would have to be
        very close to the mic.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Condenser</b> microphones are usually more powerful, meaning high end condenser mics require power sources.
        Condenser mics also specialize with crisp recording of vocals and instruments, but it doesn't handle loud sounds
        as well as a dynamic mic. This means that condenser mics are better for studio recordings. Famous artists like
        The Beatles and Frank Sinatra
        used condenser mics when recording in their studios.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Shotgun</b> microphones are a type of condenser mic, but they are highly directional. This means shotgun mics
        record sound from wherever they're pointed and attempt to cancel any noise from outside of their scope. Shotgun
        mics have excellent background noise reduction. Shotgun mics are also used as boom mics.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Lavalier</b> or <b>Lapel</b> mics are small mics that can be attatched to the subject (usually clipped
        to clothes). Lavalier or Lav mics can be wired or wireless
        but they're used for whenever the subject of the video is mobile.<b id="products"></b>

      <h2>Products</h2>
      <p>
        Since microphones are mostly plug and play, there won't be any tutorial links. Audio tests for microphones
        are available online, but they are often hidden in a long form video. We encourage users to do their own
        research aswell. Also rather than organize
        these products from low to high end, we've divided them into the types of microphones listed from low to high.<b id="dyn"></b>

            This microphone is a good budget option. It is dynamic which means it's better for loud sounds or for
            keeping out background noise.
            While you would have to be close to the microphone for things like vlogs or podcast, you'd need not worry
            when recording things like instruments (especially drums).

            This microphone is our mid-range dynamic mic. The version we have here is the XLR-only version which means
            this mic
            uses an XLR cord which does NOT come with the mic. It also means that we'd need some sort of external audio
            interface.
            There are other versions of this mic with USB connections but they're both more expensive and lower quality
            (XLR is higher quality than USB). This version of
            the mic also doesn't come with a stand. That being said if this isn't the last mic you intend to buy, an XLR
            cable and audio interface may be things you want to get regardless.
            While the USB options are more expensive, they're also more convient and for things like streaming it would
            be good enough quality.
          </p>

            This is easily the most famous podcast microphone. The biggest issue with this microphone is that it
            requires a "preamp" or a high-end audio interface.
            A preamps could range from $50 to $2000 however, they do sell a $500 version called the SM7dB that comes
            with a built in preamp.

            This microphone is our most budget friendly option. This is a USB-only microphone which means
            it often has lower quality, however this microphone is surprisingly really good. This is the perfect entry level 
            mic for beginners. For things like streaming this could be the only mic you need, but if you're
            looking to make music or a podcast, you might want to look into a better mic down the line.

             This microphone isn't a huge price change from the last. Microphones are often created for a specialized purpose.
             A mic like this would be a bit better for certain things over the AT2020, but to the average listener
             there wouldn't be a big difference if any. You would want this mic over the AT2020 if you were recording music professionally.

              This budget shotgun mic is extremely good for the price. The biggest issue with this microphone lies in the 
              threshold. Users have reported many issues with background noise. This microphone would be best for things like vlogging
              as it works best when you're around a foot away.

              This is another fairly cheap option when it comes to shotgun mics. This mic isn't as good at
              cancelling out echo so either being outside or in a dampened room is best. This mic is also 
              connected via USB-C, meaning it's rather simple to hook up to a phone.

              This microphone is the best price to quality ratio we were able to find. This lav mic is compatible with
              phones, cameras, and computers using a 3.5mm jack. This bundle comes with a lapel clip, foam windscreen, and a 3.5mm to 6.3mm adapter.
              The only downside of this bundle is that it only comes with 1 lavalier mic. This may be okay for your purposes but most retailers sell their
              mics in packs of 2. That being said $24 for 2 mics is still a good deal.

              This bundle comes with 2 lavalier mics that have an advertised 30 hour battery life.
              These mics are smaller than most wireless lav mics on the market. These are great for phones
              but they also have compatibility with cameras using 3.5mm jacks. The different versions of this product
              correspond to their connection type. The cheapest is the USB-C(linked), then is the lightning cable, then the 3.5mm jack
              These options are sold seperately or in a combo. If you plan to use them with more than 1 connection
              the bundle for $20-$30 extra is a steal.

              These 2 offer over 40 hours of recording. These mics have universal compatibility with cameras
              and smartphones. These also have the furthest range out of any of the lav mics we've looked at.
